🖥️ Single Page Application (SPA)

📘 Overview

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates the content of a single web page, instead of loading new pages from the server. This improves user experience, speed, and performance.
In this project, the SPA is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or optionally React / Angular / Vue), featuring smooth navigation, dynamic data rendering, and responsive design.

Fast Navigation – Uses JavaScript routing for seamless transitions.

Responsive Design – Works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🧩 How It Works

1. The SPA loads a single HTML page as the base structure.


2. JavaScript dynamically injects content into the DOM based on user interactions.


3. Internal routing handles navigation between sections without full reloads.


4. The browser history API ensures smooth transitions and back-button support.
